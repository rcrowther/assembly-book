Under the idea of ‘memory management’, the idea of ‘heap’ is often spliced to the idea of ‘stack’. We have already seen the idea of ‘stack’ in assembly language. What of ‘heap’?</p><p>First, ‘heap’ is not a good name. The storage has that name because once upon a time it was implemented using a ‘heap tree’. Some people call it ‘free list storage’. It might be called ‘casual reusable storage’.</p><p>‘Heap’ doesn’t exist in assembly language. In higher‐level languages ‘heap’ is used for what is called ‘dynamic storage’. Storage which can be allocated and deallocated on the fly, at runtime, by program code. Storage which has no order of use (like the stack), but is used here and there.</p><p>The following is a simple description, but may do to bridge the gap, for our purposes.</p><h2>The heap model</h2><p>Heap allocates a biggish storage at the start of runtime. Abstractly, this space has no type or divisions, it is only space. This neutral allocation could be mimiced in machine code with,</p><pre><code>Section .bss
    ; 4K = 4000/4
    heap resq dword 1000 </code></pre><p>If this seems crude, it is not. C language ‘heap’ allocations are made using a kernel command ‘sys_brk’. This allocates a big chunk of memory before the running application. Another alternative is to use ‘sys_mmap()’, which uses the operating system to allocate a page. If you prefer them to a big array, both of these calls can be used in assembly language.</p><p>Then heap management code looks after the space—allocating, extending, freeing, and reallocating. Here’s a C language snippet allocating memory,</p><pre><code>    int * cupboard = malloc(10 * sizeof(int));
    if (NULL == array) {
        fprintf(stderr, "malloc failed\n");
        return(-1);
    }</code></pre><p>The language (C or otherwise) management code will be using sophisticated access systems. It will choose the reusable space size to suit the size of computer RAM. It will likely divide the free space into chunks, and gather pointers to the chunks into lists. The GNU C library, for example, has a varying strategy depending on size requested, using a tree to track medium‐sized allocations. The free‐memory manager will track which chunks are in use, and which are not, so they can be reused.</p><p>Finally, deallocating is by the C statement,</p><pre class="c"><code>    free(cupboard)</code></pre><p>and in C++, the statement,</p><pre class="c"><code>    delete(cupboard)</code></pre><p>which means ‘finished with this chunk of memory, can use for other purposes’.</p><h2>Code</h2><p>Call ‘malloc’ and ‘free’ from assembly code,</p><pre><code>SECTION .rodata
    err_1: db cString("malloc failed")



SECTION .text

extern malloc
extern free


global main
main:
    frame


    ; int * array = malloc(1 * sizeof(int));
    mov rdi, 4
    call malloc


    ; use malloc'ed space
    println64 rax
    mov qword[rax], 78
    println64 [rax]


    ; if (NULL == array) {
    ;    fprintf(stderr, "malloc failed\n");
    ; }
    cmp rax, 0
    jnz malloc_ok
    printlnStr  err_1

    malloc_ok:
        mov rdi, rax
        call free


    unFrame
    mov rax,0	
    ret</code></pre><h2>Memory, yeah</h2><p>Efficient complex dynamic memory allocation needs a large amount of coding. This is possible in machine code, but you wouldn’t and probably shouldn’t be coding this.</p><p>That said, the efficiency of higher‐level language dynamic allocation has often been a problem. If the needs of the code are simple (a big array, say) then purpose‐built machine code may be more effective. A raw version reuses chunks of an array. If that is all you need, it will be faster than a heap.</p><p>If the needs are complex, use a dynamic allocator from a library. A C library has all you need.</p><ul class="refs"><dd>Wikipedia, dynamic allocation,</dd><dt><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_management#DYNAMIC">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_management#DYNAMIC</a></dt><dd>Wikipedia, C memory allocation,</dd><dt><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_dynamic_memory_allocation">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_dynamic_memory_allocation</a></dt><dd>(Windows) Use system calls to allocate on a heap,</dd><dt><a href="http://www.kipirvine.com/asm/articles/heap_allocation.pdf">http://www.kipirvine.com/asm/articles/heap_allocation.pdf</a></dt><dd>(Linux) Allocate on a heap,</dd><dt><a href="http://x86asm.net/articles/memory-allocation-in-linux/">http://x86asm.net/articles/memory-allocation-in-linux/</a></dt></ul></article></body></html>
